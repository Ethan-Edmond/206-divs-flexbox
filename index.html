                I love driving and motorcycles. My favorite car is my dad's jeep
                grand cherokee. It has a very high center of gravity. It has
                these "off-road" tires on it which are hard and have a lot of
                sidewall. It has almost no traction. This is what makes it so
                fun to drive.

                It's unrelated to web design, but I do have a commercial
                license. However, commercial driving is awful. You are trapped
                living in a tiny box staring at lines passing by. While a
                partner gives conversation, someone deciding when you get to
                shower isn't fun.
            </div>
            <div class="vert-between"></div>
            <div class="div-3">
                That feeling of being trapped is also just part of having a low
                income. Web development is fun and creative and definitely does
                not feel trapping. Even doing something repetitive can be an
                interesting computer programming problem.
